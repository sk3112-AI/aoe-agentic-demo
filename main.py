            * Confirm the test drive details (vehicle, date, location) immediately, emphasizing excitement.
            * Example: "<p>Dear {full_name},</p><p>We are thrilled to confirm your upcoming test drive of the {vehicle} on {formatted_date} in {location}. Get ready for an exhilarating experience!</p>"

        * **Paragraph 2 (Vehicle Features & Persuasive Comparison - Simplified Language):**
            * From the provided {chosen_aoe_features}, **select and highlight only 2-3 MOST EXCITING and UNIQUE features**.
            * **Crucially, translate any technical jargon into simple, benefit-oriented language, focusing on what the feature *does for the driver* and the *experience* it provides.** For example, instead of "V8 Twin-Turbo Engine," phrase it as "a powerful engine designed for exhilarating acceleration." If the feature is "Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS)", explain its benefit like "advanced safety features that provide peace of mind." **Do NOT use acronyms without immediate, simple explanation.**
            * Integrate these naturally into the paragraph, explicitly mentioning its {vehicle_type} and {powertrain_type}. Do NOT simply list features or include more than 3 distinct features in this paragraph.
            * **Crucial Comparison Logic:**
                * If `current_vehicle` is provided (and not 'No-vehicle' or 'exploring'), subtly position the {vehicle} as a significant, transformative upgrade. Example: "As a {current_vehicle} owner, prepare to experience the next level of automotive innovation with the AOE {vehicle} {vehicle_type}, a remarkable {powertrain_type} vehicle that offers..." **Avoid any blunt or negative comparisons.**
                * If `current_vehicle` is 'No-vehicle' or 'exploring', frame it as an exciting new kind of driving experience, a leap into advanced {powertrain_type} {vehicle_type} technology, or an opportunity to discover what makes AOE Motors unique.

        * **Paragraph 3 (Overall Experience & Broader Benefits - NO new features):**
            * This paragraph should focus on the *overall driving experience* of the {vehicle} or the * broader benefits* of choosing an AOE vehicle.
            * **Do NOT introduce any new specific features in this paragraph.** This paragraph is for a more general, appealing description.
            * If `current_vehicle` is 'exploring', this paragraph can reinforce the idea of discovery, reliability, and the unique possibilities the {vehicle} offers for their lifestyle.
            * Example: "<p>Beyond its impressive features, the AOE {vehicle} is engineered for a harmonious blend of exhilarating performance and sophisticated comfort, ensuring every drive is a pleasure.</p>" (This is an example, LLM should adapt.)

        * **Paragraph 4 (Personalized Support for Your Journey - CRITICAL IMPLICIT FIX for 'exploring'):**
            * This paragraph will *exclusively* address the '{time_frame}' for *purchase intent*.
            * **CRITICAL: This paragraph MUST NOT explicitly mention '{time_frame}' or any specific timeframe (e.g., '0-3 months', '3-6 months', '6-12 months', 'exploring'). Convey the time frame *implicitly* through the tone and focus of the support offered, using phrasing that aligns with their readiness.**
            * **Do NOT use any phrasing that implies urgency or a swift decision for 'exploring'.**
            * If `time_frame` is '0-3-months': Emphasize AOE Motors' readiness to support their swift decision, hinting at tailored support and exclusive opportunities for those ready to embrace the future soon.
                * *Example Implicit Phrasing:* "We understand you're ready to make a swift decision, and our team is poised to offer tailored support and exclusive opportunities as you approach ownership."
            * If `time_frame` is '3-6-months' or '6-12-months': Focus on offering continued guidance and resources throughout their decision-making journey, highlighting that you're ready to assist them when they're closer to a purchase decision, providing resources for further exploration.
                * *Example Implicit Phrasing:* "As you carefully consider your options over the coming months, we are committed to providing comprehensive support and insights to help you make an informed choice."
            * If `time_frame` is 'exploring': Maintain a welcoming, low-pressure tone, focusing purely on discovery and making the experience informative and enjoyable for their future consideration, without any hint of urgency or swift decisions. The goal is to provide resources and be available for questions at their pace.
                * *Example Implicit Phrasing (stronger emphasis for 'exploring', and explicit negative constraint for LLM):* "We are delighted to support you at your own pace as you explore the possibilities. There's no pressure; our team is here to provide any information or answer any questions you may have as you consider your options for the future." **Absolutely avoid any phrasing like 'swift decision', 'ready to make a purchase', 'approach ownership' for 'exploring' customers.**

        * **Paragraph 5 (Valuable Resources):**
            * Provide a sentence encouraging them to learn more.
            * Include two distinct hyperlinks: one for the `YouTube Link` (e.g., "Watch the AOE {vehicle} Overview Video") and one for the `PDF Guide Link` (e.g., "Download the AOE {vehicle} Guide (PDF)").
