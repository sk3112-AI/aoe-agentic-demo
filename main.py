        3.  **STRICT Formatting Output Rules (MUST use HTML <p> tags):**
            * **The entire email body MUST be composed of distinct HTML paragraph tags (`<p>...</p>`).**
            * **Each logical section/paragraph MUST be entirely enclosed within its own `<p>` and `</p>` tags.**
            * **Each paragraph (`<p>...</p>`) should be concise (typically 2-4 sentences maximum).**
            * **Aim for a total of 5-7 distinct HTML paragraphs.**
            * **DO NOT use `\\n\\n` for spacing; the `<p>` tags provide the necessary visual separation.**
            * **DO NOT include any section dividers (like '---').**
            * **Ensure there is no extra blank space before the first `<p>` tag or after the last `</p>` tag.**

        **Content Structure & Logic (Each point should be a distinct HTML paragraph):**

        * **Paragraph 1 (Greeting & Test Drive Confirmation):**
            * Confirm the test drive details (vehicle, date, location) immediately, emphasizing excitement.
            * Example: "<p>Dear {full_name},</p><p>We are thrilled to confirm your upcoming test drive of the {vehicle} on {formatted_date} in {location}. Get ready for an exhilarating experience!</p>"

        * **Paragraph 2 (Vehicle Features & Persuasive Comparison):**
            * From the provided {chosen_aoe_features}, **select and highlight only 2-3 MOST EXCITING and UNIQUE features**. Integrate these naturally into the paragraph, explicitly mentioning its {vehicle_type} and {powertrain_type}.
            * Focus on the *experience* and *benefits* those 2-3 features provide. Do NOT simply list features or include more than 3.
            * **Crucial Comparison Logic:**
                * If `current_vehicle` is provided (and not 'no vehicle' or 'exploring'), subtly position the {vehicle} as a significant, transformative upgrade. Example: "As a {current_vehicle} owner, prepare to experience the next level of automotive innovation with the AOE {vehicle} {vehicle_type}, a remarkable {powertrain_type} vehicle that offers..." **Avoid any blunt or negative comparisons.**
                * If `current_vehicle` is 'no vehicle' or 'exploring', frame it as an exciting new kind of driving experience, a leap into advanced {powertrain_type} {vehicle_type} technology, or an opportunity to discover what makes AOE Motors unique.

        * **Paragraph 3 (Personalized Support for Your Journey - CRITICAL IMPLICIT FIX):**
            * This paragraph will *exclusively* address the '{time_frame}' for *purchase intent*.
            * **CRITICAL: This paragraph MUST NOT explicitly mention '{time_frame}' or any specific timeframe (e.g., '0-3 months', '3-6 months', '6-12 months', 'exploring'). Convey the time frame *implicitly* through the tone and focus of the support offered, using phrasing that aligns with their readiness.**
            * If `time_frame` is '0-3-months': Emphasize AOE Motors' readiness to support their swift decision, hinting at tailored support and exclusive opportunities for those ready to embrace the future soon.
                * *Example Implicit Phrasing:* "We understand you're ready to make a swift decision, and our team is poised to offer tailored support and exclusive opportunities as you approach ownership."
            * If `time_frame` is '3-6-months' or '6-12-months': Focus on offering continued guidance and resources throughout their decision-making journey, highlighting that you're ready to assist them when they're closer to a purchase decision, providing resources for further exploration.
                * *Example Implicit Phrasing:* "As you carefully consider your options over the coming months, we are committed to providing comprehensive support and insights to help you make an fresh choice."
            * If `time_frame` is 'exploring': Maintain a welcoming, low-pressure tone, focusing on discovery and making the experience informative and enjoyable for their future consideration, without implying urgency.
                * *Example Implicit Phrasing:* "We invite you to take your time exploring all the innovative features of the {vehicle} and discover how AOE Motors can fit your lifestyle, without any pressure."

        * **Paragraph 4 (Valuable Resources):**
            * Provide a sentence encouraging them to learn more.
            * Include two distinct hyperlinks: one for the `YouTube Link` (e.g., "Watch the AOE {vehicle} Overview Video") and one for the `PDF Guide Link` (e.g., "Download AOE {vehicle} Guide (PDF)").
            * Example: "<p>To learn even more about the {vehicle}, we invite you to watch our detailed video: <a href=\"{youtube_link}\">Watch the AOE {vehicle} Overview Video</a> and download the comprehensive guide: <a href=\"{pdf_link}\">Download AOE {vehicle} Guide (PDF)</a>.</p>"

        * **Paragraph 5 (Call to Action & Closing):**
            * Conclude with a clear and helpful call to action for any questions.
            * Express eagerness for their visit.
            * End with "Warm regards, Team AOE Motors" **within the same final paragraph's `<p>` tags.**
